#' Hidden-Markov-Model using separate emission probabilities for rewards and punishments
#'
#' @param formula response formula specifying the response and its prediction.
#'        For models of class \code{'hmm_rp'} this formula needs to define the
#'        response on the left-hand side, a variable coded as 1 or 2, and the
#'        feedback (aka outcome) on the right-hand side, coded as 1 or -1. In
#'        addition, you can define the block structure on the left-hand side
#'        of the formula. That is, a formula like
#'        \code{choice|block(id) ~ reward} would update the HMM's probabilities
#'        for state 1 and state 2 based on each trials choice and reward
#'        starting from the first row in \code{data} until
#'        \code{id[n] != id[n-1]}. I that case, updating of probabilities
#'        starts again from starting values \code{c(0.5, 0.5)}.
#' @param ... You can pass further formulas to define predictions of parameters
#'        used in the response formula. Any non-formula objects passed via
#'        `...` are passed on to other functions (i.e., `brmsformula` and
#'        `brm`)

#' @inheritParams blms_model
#'
#' @returns If `formula_only` is `TRUE` then the return value is an object of
#'        class `blmsformula` (inheriting from class `brmsformula`), else the
#'        return value is of class `blmsfit` (inheriting from class `brmsfit`)
